I judge others harshly, and myself even more severely.
I put too much trust in those who wield power within my templeâ€™s hierarchy.
My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess faith in my god.
I am inflexible in my thinking.
I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them.
Once I pick a goal, I become obsessed with it to the detriment of everything else in my life.
I can't resist a pretty face.
I'm always in debt. I spend my ill-gotten gains on decadent luxuries faster than I bring them in.
I'm convinced that no one could ever fool me the way I fool others.
I'm too greedy for my own good. I can't resist taking a risk if there's money involved.
I can't resist swindling people who are more powerful than me.
I hate to admit it and will hate myself for it, but I'll run and preserve my own hide if the going gets tough.
When I see something valuable, I can't think about anything but how to steal it.
When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money.
If there's a plan, I'll forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll ignore it.
I have a "tell" that reveals when I'm lying.
I turn tail and run when things look bad.
An innocent person is in prison for a crime that I committed. I'm okay with that.
